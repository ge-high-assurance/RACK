## [v4.1] - 2020-12-17

This release has the following changes:

- Added [STR ontology](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/tree/master/STR-Ontology) overlays
- Added a set of generic [ingestion nodegroups](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/tree/master/nodegroups/ingestion) and [CDRs](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/tree/master/nodegroups/CDR)
- Created finer wasDerivedFrom distinctions in RACK ontology

## [v4.0] - 2020-12-07

This release has the following changes:

- Moved a few directories out of RACK-Ontology to their own places
- Added [GrammaTech ontology](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/tree/master/GrammaTech-Ontology) overlays
- Added SPARQLgraph [union queries](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/wiki/Queries-Advanced-Topics)
- Added [Provenance-Example](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/tree/master/Provenance-Example) illustrating how to record who, when, and how data is entered into RACK
- Updated Turnstile sample data with examples of `satisfiedBy` DO-178C objectives (see [Objective.csv](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/blob/master/Turnstile-Ontology/99-Utils/Data/Objective.csv) and the [Objective ingest nodegroup](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/blob/master/Turnstile-Ontology/99-Utils/NodeGroups/Ingest-Objective.json))
- Automated ingestion for Turnstile data (node groups and SADL files used to generate CSV files, in turn used to run queries, in turn used to generate CSV files for data ingestion)
