# How to generate a changelog for the next release

Download git-chglog from [https://github.com/git-chglog/git-chglog].

Put git-chglog in PATH.

Already done: Run `git-chglog --init` and accept all defaults (doesn't
need to be repeated unless you want to overwrite
`.chglog/CHANGELOG.tpl.md` and `.chglog/config.yml` with new
versions).

Run `git-chglog --next-tag v7.0 -o .chglog/CHANGELOG-new.md`, edit
`.chglog/CHANGELOG.tpl.md` to tweak the output if necessary, and
repeat if needed.

Find out automatically generated changelog isn't that useful.
Individual git commit messages are too fine-grained and merge commits
don't include any text from the pull requests' descriptions.

End up creating a changelog for the next release using
`.chglog/CHANGELOG-new.md` only as a guide to navigate to pull
requests in GitHub and look at their descriptions and changes.  Write
new changelog manually and insert new changelog into
`.chglog/CHANGELOG.md`.
