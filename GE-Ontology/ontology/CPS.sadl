// In https://www.faa.gov/documentLibrary/media/Advisory_Circular/AC%2023.1309-1E.pdf
// the DALs (Catastrophic, Hazardous, Major,Minor, No Safety Effect) are mapped to
// allowable quantitative failure probabilities for classes of aircraft.
// So, for Class IV aircraft and Catastrophic DAL the allowable failure probability is 1E-9.

DAL (note "Design Assurance Level: a value 9 represents allowable failure probability of 1E-9, etc.") 
	is a type of int [0,9]. 
ResidualRisk (note "The risk that remains after controls have been applied to mitigate threats.") 
	is a type of int [0,1].
	
Cps (note "A cyber physical system") is a type of SYSTEM
	described by cpsType with a single value of type CpsType 
	described by inputPort with values of type Port 
	described by outputPort with values of type Port
	  
	// properties that allow for inferring threats
	described by canReceiveSWUpdate with a single value of type boolean

	described by hasSensitiveInfo with a single value of type boolean	
	described by insideTrustedBoundary with a single value of type boolean
	described by pedigree with a single value of type Pedigree

	// properties that allow for mitigating of threats
	described by implControl with values of type ImplControl.
	
ImplControl (note "CONTROL implemented in a SYSTEM") is a type of THING
	described by control with a single value of type CONTROL
	described by dal with a single value of type DAL.

CpsType (note "An open/extensible set of CPS types") is a type of THING.

// A few common instances:
Software is a CpsType 
	has identifier "Software"
	has description "The code that runs on a device.".
Hardware is a CpsType 
	has identifier "Hardware"
	has description "The physical device in a system.".
SwHwHybrid is a CpsType 
	has identifier "SwHwHybrid"
	has description "A hardware component that also includes software".

Pedigree (note "Describes source of say a CPS") is a type of THING.

// A few common instances:
InternallyDeveloped is a Pedigree 
	has identifier "InternallyDeveloped"
	has description "Development is done in house.".
COTS is a Pedigree 
	has identifier "COTS"
	has description "Commercial Of The Shelf products that are bought as is".
Sourced is a Pedigree 
	has identifier "Sourced"
	has description "The system is provides by an outside organization.". 
	
Port (note "Ports specify points of connections between CPSs") is a type of ENTITY.

Connection (note "An INTERFACE with specific input and output ports") is a type of INTERFACE
    // for named connections, use "title" property
	described by outPort with a single value of type Port 
	described by inPort with a single value of type Port 

	// properties that allow for inferring threats	
	described by connectionType with values of type ConnectionType

ConnectionType is a type of THING.

Trusted is a ConnectionType 
	has identifier "Trusted"
	has description "Developed and tested to be secure.".	
Untrusted is a ConnectionType 
	has identifier "Untrusted"
	has description "May be susceptible to security attacks.".
