/* ACERT requirements have confidence parameters on text extraction */
AcertRequirementModel is a type of MODEL.

    textConfidence (note "confidence that this was requirement text")
        describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type double.
	
	ifText (note "conditions under which this requirement holds")
	    describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type string.
    ifTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the if-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type double.

	thenText (note "specifies what should hold by this requirement if the requirement conditions are met")
		describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type string.    
    thenTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the then-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type double.
	
	givenText (note "optional part that can be used to set certain conditions apart from other conditions in the ifText part")
		describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type string.
    givenTextConfidence (note "confidence that this was the given-portion of the text")
        describes AcertRequirementModel with values of type double.

AcertTestResult is a type of TEST_RESULT.
    failureReason (note "reason for failure, e.g.: timeout, crash, bad output")
        describes AcertTestResult with values of type FailureReason.

	failureDetails (note "Additional detail describing the failure reason")
	    describes AcertTestResult with values of type string.

    /* Metrics */
    cpuTime (note "seconds of CPU time used when executing the test execution")
        describes TEST_EXECUTION with values of type double.

    memory (note "maximum bytes of resident memory used by test execution")
        describes TEST_EXECUTION with values of type double.

FailureReason (note "High-level reasons for ACERT test result failure")
    is a type of THING,
    must be one of {Timeout, Crash, DifferentOutput, Assert}.
Timeout         is a FailureReason with identifier "Timeout".
Crash           is a FailureReason with identifier "Crash".
DifferentOutput is a FailureReason with identifier "DifferentOutput".
Assert          is a FailureReason with identifier "Assert".
