# Setup

Using nix, you just need to enter the shell (using `nix-shell`) to be in an
environment with python installed and libadalang installed.  To double-check,
run the `python` REPL and type `import libadalang`.

We recommend using `direnv` to automatically load the shell environment for you
whenever you enter this directory.
