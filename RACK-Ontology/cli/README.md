# RACK CLI

The RACK command-line interface (the `rack` program) can

- [initialize](#initialize-rack-in-a-box) RACK-in-a-Box
- [import data](#import-data) into RACK-in-a-Box from CSV files
- [export data](#export-data) from RACK-in-a-Box to CSV files

To do its work, the rack program uses the Node Execution Group REST
API which is documented in the [REST API Swagger
Demo](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/REST-API-Swagger-Demo)
and [REST
cookbook](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/wiki/REST-cookbook) wiki
pages.

## Install dependencies

The rack program requires the
[semtk-python3](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk-python3) package and
other requirements listed in `requirements.txt`.

We recommend installing these dependencies in an isolated virtual
environment using [virtualenv](https://pypi.org/project/virtualenv/)
to ensure reproducibility of results.

<!--
Note for documentation authors: These instructions should be kept in sync with
the RACK-Box README.
-->
```shell
virtualenv venv
source venv/bin/activate
pip install --force -r requirements.txt
python3 setup.py install
```

## Initialize RACK-in-a-Box

We have written a shell script called `setup-rack.sh` which will call
the `rack` program to initialize a RACK-in-a-Box instance with the
RACK ontology model and some default data.  It is assumed that you are
still in the isolated Python virtual environment and running a
RACK-in-a-Box instance in a Docker container on `localhost`.  Here is
how to run `setup-rack.sh` and what its output may look like:

```shell
(venv) $ ./setup-rack.sh

## How to use the rack program

The rack program accepts the following command line arguments:

```text
usage: rack [-h] [--base-url BASE_URL] [--triple-store TRIPLE_STORE] [--log-level LOG_LEVEL] {data,model,nodegroups} ...

RACK in a Box toolkit

positional arguments:
  {data,model,nodegroups}
    data                Import or export CSV data
    model               Interact with SemTK model
    nodegroups          Interact with SemTK nodegroups

optional arguments:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --base-url BASE_URL   Base SemTK instance URL
  --triple-store TRIPLE_STORE
                        Override Fuseki URL
  --log-level LOG_LEVEL
                        Assign logger severity level
```

The `rack` command is split into three subcommands: `data`, `model`, and `nodegroups`. Each of these subcommands offers its own help listing. For example try `rack data --help` for more information about the flags available when interacting with the data store.

The `model` subcommand is used to load the ontology itself. This is typically only done at the initial configuration step for RACK.

The `nodegroups` subcommand is used to import and export nodegroups from SemTK. This is useful both for initial configuration and also for persisting your generated nodegroups across RACK instances.

The `data` subcommand is used to import CSV and OWL data files using the RACK ontology as well as exporting CSV files using nodegroups stored in SemTK.

## Data Ingestion Configuration file format

The import configuration files are YAML files that specify the target
`data-graph` and `ingestion-steps`. These files will be the argument to a `rack data import` command.

`data-graph` is a graph identifier URL. This URL allows multiple
datasets to be stored in the same triple store.

`ingestion-steps` takes an ordered list of CSV and OWL file imports used to populate the graph.

CSV files can be ingested by adding list elements containing a `csv` path and a `nodegroup` that lists an existing nodegroup ID in RACK. CSV paths are resolved relative to the configuration file.

OWL files can be ingested by adding list elements containing an `owl` path to the OWL file.

```text
data-model: "http://rack001/data"
ingestion-steps:
- {nodegroup: "ingest01 system",    csv: "SYSTEM.csv"}
- {nodegroup: "ingest02 interface", csv: "INTERFACE.csv"}
- {owl: "example.owl"}
```

## Overriding default RACK URLs

Connecting to RACK requires knowledge of the SemTK and Fuseki URLs. The RACK cli assumes that these URLs will be at their default locations on `localhost`. These URLs can be overridden using either command-line flags or environment variables.

### SemTK URL

- Default value: `http://localhost`
- Override flag: `--base-url`
- Override environment variable: `BASE_URL`

### Fuseki URL

- Default value: *Base URL* + `:3030/RACK`
- Override flags: `--triple-store`
- Override environment variable: `TRIPLE_STORE`

## Example invocations

These examples uses the virtual environment as defined in the
*Installing Dependencies* section above.

### Import data

This example populates the *Turnstile* example into a RACK-in-a-Box
instance running in a Docker container on `localhost`:

```shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ rack data import --clear ../models/TurnstileSystem/Data/import.yaml
Clearing graph

Loading ingest11 format...                         OK Records: 6       Failures: 0

Loading ingest14 confidence...                     OK Records: 2       Failures: 0
```

### Export data

This example exports instances of the `SYSTEM` class from the
*Turnstile* example from a Rack-in-a-Box instance running in a Docker
container on `localhost`:

```shell
$ source venv/bin/activate
(venv) $ rack data export "ingest01 system" http://rack001/data

identifier     identifier_parent
-------------------  -------------------------
TurnStileSystem
Counter Application  TurnStileSystem
Display              TurnStileSystem
ExecutiveThread      Counter Application
In Gate              TurnStileSystem
InputThread          Counter Application
Out Gate             TurnStileSystem
OutputThread         Counter Application
```

See `rack data export --help` for options, including different export
formats (such as CSV), emitting to a file, and omitting the header
row.

### Count result rows

The number of results a nodegroup would generate can be obtained
using the `count` sub-command.

```shell
(venv) $ rack data count "ingest07 test results" "http://rack001/data"
16
```

### Update Nodegroups

The script can automate loading a directory full of nodegroups
indexed by a `store_data.csv` file.

```shell
(venv) $ rack nodegroups import ../../nodegroups/ingestion
Storing nodegroups...                                       OK
```

It can also export nodegroups matching a regular expression
into a directory alongside its `store_data.csv` file for future
loads.

```shell
(venv) $ mkdir outdir
(venv) $ rack nodegroups export ^queries outdir
Retrieving nodegroups...                                    OK
(venv) $ ls outdir
query Compilation Inputs.json                   query Requirements without Tests.json
query Control Flow From Function.json           query System Structure.json
...
```
