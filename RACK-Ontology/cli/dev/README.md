# Hacking

The following documentation is only useful for developers of this script.

## SemTK API Documentation

Documentation on the REST API is available on the
[REST API Swagger Demo](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/REST-API-Swagger-Demo)
and [REST cookbook](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/wiki/REST-cookbook) wiki pages.

## Mypy

This script has [Mypy](http://mypy-lang.org)-compliant type annotations which
are used to statically type-check the code. Usage is simple:
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r dev/requirements.txt
$ mypy .
```

## Tests

You can run the tests with `pytest`:
```bash
$ source venv/bin/activate
$ pip install -r dev/requirements.txt
$ python3 setup.py install && pytest
```
Note that you should _always install the code before testing_.

If you see an error message like this:
```
Couldn't connect to Docker daemon at http+docker://localhost - is it running?
```
the pytest process likely doesn't have enough privileges to run the RACK-in-a-box Docker container. On most Linux distros, you can use the following:
```bash
sudo -g docker pytest
```
