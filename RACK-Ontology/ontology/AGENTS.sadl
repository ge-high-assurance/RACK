/************** edit history *****************
 *
 * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - reduced cardinality of 'employedBy' to 1, because N seems ill-defined or unnecessary
 * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - removed 'name' as a string property because it was pushed down into the AGENT base class - see edit in PROV-S.sadl
 * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - added 'version' as a string property for TOOL agents
 * am - 31 Aug 2021 - altered employedBy so that range and cardinality info is separated out; and use "1" instead of "one"
