/************** edit history *****************
  *
  * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - changed ANALYSIS_REPORT to a kind of REPORT vs. ENTITY, since REPORT is defined already
  * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - minor updates to note fields
  * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - reduced cardinality of result in ANALYSIS_REPORT to 1, since N seems ill-defined
  * dwa - 11 Nov 2020 - reduced cardinality of ANALYSIS_REPORT in ANALYSIS_ANNOTATION to 1, since an annotation will naturally come from a single report
  * dwa - 13 Nov 2020 - added import for DOCUMENT to allow ANALYSIS_REPORT to be a kind of REPORT
