/* Baselines are used to identify a named collection of
 * entities that constitute a release of all or part of
 * a software project. These baselines are objective data
 * and should correspond to collections of data identified
 * by the project being modeled. They are not arbitrary
 * groupings or intended to be the results of analysis.
 * 
 * The the use of baselines a single RACK instance can contain
 * multiple versions of the same project concurrently. This
 * serves a role in enabling RACK to distingusish the entities
 * contained in one version or the other, and allows us to compute
 * how those versions are related.
 * 
 * Baselines are expected to be potentially built compositionally.
 * Nodegroups should use generally use transitive membership.
 * 
 * Baselines can be the subject of REVIEW activities to capture the
 * formal review processes that are often related to baselines.
 * 
 * Baselines can use wasRevisionOf to capture version evolution.
 * 
 * Baselines are meant to directly include the top-most elements.
 * For example, they will contain a document but not decomposed
 * sections and requirements contained in that document.
