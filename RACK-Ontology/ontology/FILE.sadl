definedIn (note "The file a THING is defined or contained in") describes THING with values of type FILE.

FILE
	(note "A file in a filesystem")
	is a type of ENTITY.

	filename (note "A logical file path relative to the container of the file.") describes FILE with a single value of type string.

	fileFormat (note "The byte-level encoding of a file") describes FILE with values of type FORMAT.

    satisfies (note "ENTITY(s) (e.g. REQUIREMENT) that this code file participates in satisfying") describes FILE with values of type ENTITY.
    satisfies is a type of wasImpactedBy.

    createBy (note "FILE_CREATION ACTIVITY that created this file") describes FILE with values of type FILE_CREATION.
    createBy describes FILE with at most 1 value.
    createBy is a type of wasGeneratedBy.
    
    fileHash (note "Hash of the file contents") describes FILE with values of type FILE_HASH.

FORMAT
    (note "The data format of a FILE")
    is a type of THING.

FILE_CREATION
   (note "An ACTIVITY that produces a FILE")
   is a type of ACTIVITY.

FILE_HASH
    (note "A hash identifying a FILE")
    is a type of THING,
    described by hashType (note "Hash algorithm")  with a single value of type HASH_TYPE,
    described by hashValue (note "Hash value") with a single value of type string.

HASH_TYPE
    (note "A type of cryptographic hash")
    is a type of THING,
    must be one of { MD5, SHA1, SHA2_256, SHA2_512 }.
MD5      is a HASH_TYPE with identifier "MD5".
SHA1     is a HASH_TYPE with identifier "SHA1".
SHA2_256 is a HASH_TYPE with identifier "SHA2_256".
SHA2_512 is a HASH_TYPE with identifier "SHA2_512".
