HWCOMPONENT is a type of ENTITY.
    instantiates (note "What logical component (system) does this physical component instantiate or implement?")
        describes HWCOMPONENT with values of type ENTITY.
    componentType (note "Type of component")
        describes HWCOMPONENT with a single value of type COMPONENT_TYPE.
	partitions describes HWCOMPONENT with values of type PARTITION.

PARTITION (note "a PARTIION divides a HWCOMPOENTS resources into protected, isolated execution space for software components.") is a type of ENTITY.

COMPONENT_TYPE
    (note "An open/extensible set of types of hardware components")
    is a type of THING.
Sensor
    (note "a hardware component that interacts with the physical world outside the system of interest")
    is a COMPONENT_TYPE
    has identifier "Sensor".
Bus
    (note "a bus is a connection between hardware components that communicates data between the components")
    is a COMPONENT_TYPE
    has identifier "Bus".    
    
ComputePlatform
    (note "a compute platform is a piece of hardware that executes software")
    is a COMPONENT_TYPE
    has identifier "ComputePlatform".
