CWE-304,"The software implements an authentication technique, but it skips a step that weakens the technique."
CWE-305,"The authentication algorithm is sound, but the implemented mechanism can be bypassed as the result of a separate weakness that is primary to the authentication error."
CWE-306,The software does not perform any authentication for functionality that requires a provable user identity or consumes a significant amount of resources.

CWE-357,"The user interface provides a warning to a user regarding dangerous or sensitive operations, but the warning is not noticeable enough to warrant attention."
CWE-359,"The product does not properly prevent a person's private, personal information from being accessed by actors who either (1) are not explicitly authorized to access the information or (2) do not have the implicit consent of the person about whom the information is collected."
