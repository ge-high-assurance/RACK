// We model THREAT only as an ATTACK is an activity on say a fielded system.
THREAT (note "A threat / vulnerability to be assessed for certification") is a type of ENTITY.
	Sec:source (note "ENTITY(s) that participate in causing this HAZARD") describes THREAT with values of type ENTITY.
	Sec:source is a type of wasImpactedBy.

	identified (note "how this HAZARD was identified") describes THREAT with values of type THREAT_IDENTIFICATION.

	effect (note "consequence(s) of the HAZARD") describes THREAT with values of type string.
   	effect describes THREAT with at most 1 value.

	severity (note "the severity of the HAZARD") describes THREAT with values of type float. // [0,1].
	severity describes THREAT with at most 1 value.

	likelihood (note "probability value between 0 and 1") describes THREAT with values of type float. // [0,1].
	likelihood describes THREAT with at most 1 value.

THREAT_IDENTIFICATION
	(note "ACTIVITY that identifies potential sources of THREAT whose risk must be evaluated")
	is a type of ACTIVITY.

	Sec:author (note "AGENT(s) who work on this ACTIVITY") describes THREAT_IDENTIFICATION with values of type AGENT.
	Sec:author is a type of wasAssociatedWith.

SECURITY_LABEL is a type of THING.

// A few common instances: additional ones could be Authorization, Non-repudiation, Privacy, etc.
Confidentiality is a SECURITY_LABEL 
	has identifier "Confidentiality"
	has description "No unauthorized information is disclosed.".
Integrity is a SECURITY_LABEL 
	has identifier "Integrity"
	has description "Maintain data accuracy.".
Availability is a SECURITY_LABEL
	has identifier "Availability"
	has description "Information / functionality is available when needed.". 

CONTROL (note "CONTROLs mitigate THREATs") is a type of ENTITY.

CONTROLSET is a type of COLLECTION.
    content of CONTROLSET only has values of type CONTROL.

    // A THREAT can be mitigated by a set of CONTROLs etc., mitigation by CONTROL is defined in CONTROL.sadl.
	// In general, a THREAT T may be mitigated by "(C1 and C2) or (C3 and C4 and C5)" which is represented in a disjunctive normal form,
	// each CONTROLSET provides the conjunctions and the the disjunction via multiple CONTROLSET.
	Sec:mitigates (note "ENTITY(s) (e.g. THREAT) that is being mitigated by this CONTROLSET") describes CONTROLSET with values of type THREAT.
