DesCert,ArchSpec_QuasiPeriodicMultiRateSubsystem_ComputationalModelRestriction,ArchSpec QuasiPeriodicMultiRateSubsystem ComputationalModelRestriction,"Property Objective: Software architecture of ArduPilot Advanced Fail Safe (AFS) subsystem conforms and is restricted to quasi-periodic multi-rate computational model.
Property met rationale: ArduPilot Advanced Fail Safe (AFS) subsystem include afs_gateway and afs_function that are specified in afs.radl with document identifier DOCUMENT_RADL_Specification_ArduPilot_AFS_1. Radler build process used the afs.radl specification which included multiple rates of different computational nodes (tasks running at fixed period) with communicating topics/messages between publishers and subscribers over channels with expectation of guaranteed delivery and latency/timing/delays.  Radler compiles the associated software source code related to afs_gateway and afs_function (RADL nodes of AFS) and then executes the code within a ROS environment with a fixed period that is may or may not vary but is bounded (i.e. period may vary between min and max clock)."
DesCert,ArchSpec_ComputationalModel_ComunicationLatencyTimingBufferSizeAndMessageFreshness,ArchSpec ComputationalModel ComunicationLatencyTimingBufferSizeAndMessageFreshness,"Property Objective: Quasi-periodic computational model of any RADL architecture and in particular ArduPilot Advanced Fail Safe (AFS) subsystem has the following 5 properties: (1) Bounded processing latency for any message/topic between every pair of publisher and subscriber (2) communication messages are delivered in order i.e. no overtaking, with timing assumptions (3) Given fixed buffer (including size 1), consecutive message losses can be bounded (4) Message Loss can be eliminated with Bounded queue length which can be used to provision communication channel for transporting message/topic between publisher & subscribers appropriately and (5) Age and/or Freshness of any message at any subscriber in terms of time steps is bounded.
Property met rationale: Analysis results presented in documents with identifiers DOCUMENT_RADL_Paper_Memocode_2014, DOCUMENT_RADL_Slides_Memocode_2014  and summarized in documents with identifiers DOCUMENT_RADL_Paper_Memocode_2015, DOCUMENT_RADL_Slides_Memocode_2015."
DesCert,ArchSpec_RuntimeCodeMonitor_PlatformAssumptions,ArchSpec RuntimeCodeMonitor PlatformAssumptions,"Property Objective: Radler, validates platform/physical layer performance when bound to logical layer functions as well as any other assumptions on the architectural model used in verifying any other properties, for any RADL Specification and  in particular ArduPilot Advanced Fail Safe (AFS) subsystem,  the following 4 properties are always held at run-time: (1) No stale message received after it's latency and period (2) every message is never received more than it's timeout duration latency and period (3)  system healthy and no failures and (4)max latencies, node periods, execution times adheres to the specifications.
Property met rationale: Radler enforces for each node, a state structure, an initialization function, a step function, and a finish function code structure as well as generates the communication layer (glue code), the scheduler, the overall compilation script and configuration files, and builds an executable for each machine. Radler also instruments the code for runtime monitoring and validation of platform performance and assumptions. Please see detailed rationale in documents with identifiers DOCUMENT_RADL_Paper_Memocode_2015, DOCUMENT_RADL_Slides_Memocode_2015."
DesCert,ArchSpec_Robust_Time_and_Space_Partitioning,ArchSpec Robust Time and Space Partitioning,"Property Objective: Physical Layer of RADL Architectural Specification and in particular ArduPilot Advanced Fail Safe (AFS) subsystem physical layer has robust time and space partitioning.
Property met rationale: Robust Space Partitioning based on the memory partitioning strategy in the specification depending on whether the two RADL nodes in  are in (1) same virtual machine within a RTOS  or  (2) two different virtual machines with different individual RTOS but in the same hypervisor within a single machine or (3) two machines then the Radler will ensure provisioning respectively for (1) a shared memory ring buffer (intra partition) or (2)  a ring buffer will be setup in a memory region shared
between those two virtual machine with message passing APIs (inter-partition) and (3) IP-based communication will be used with queuing and sampling ports (inter-partition) appropriately. Robust time partitioning with WCETs for every step function (computation duration) within each RADL node being specified in the RADL specification and also subsequently  radler tool is also able to generate an instrumented version of the software code and monitor the system with runtime checks for violations of  timing properties such as maximum latency of channels, node periods, execution times, etc. The radler tool also generates local system log that radler can be analyzed and validated against the architecture specification. Such runtime checks are often the only way of validating the timing parameters assumed by the model. Please see detailed rationale in documents with identifiers DOCUMENT_RADL_Paper_Memocode_2015, DOCUMENT_RADL_Slides_Memocode_2015."
