# Counter Software

Fake counter software for the turnstile system.

## Importing Software Data

The build process is uses the RACK ASSIST functionality to
automatically generate FILE and SOFTWARE namespace instances for the
various components used in and generated by the build process, as well
as recording the build tools used and users running the build.

To setup for using the ASSIST tooling:

```
$ export PATH=..<path-to>../RACK/assist/databin:..<path-to>../RACK/assist/bin:$PATH
```

To capture the information about the build, files and tools involved, and other elements:

```
$ cd ..<path-to>../RACK/Turnstile-Ontology/02-Software/03-Implementation
$ make clean
$ make test
$ make dist
```

To upload this data into the RACK instance, the `ingest_data` tool can
be run with the Turnstile-specific data extensions in the
`turnstile-ingest.rack`.

```
$ ingest_data \
    -r ..<path-to>../RACK/Turnstile-Ontology/02-Software/turnstile-ingest.rack \
    http://Turnstile/CounterApplication \
    ..<path-to>../RACK/Turnstile-Ontology
```

The `ingest_data` command can be run with no arguments to get help usage data.

If run without the `turnstile-ingest.rack` supplemental data
recognizers then standard RACK Ontology elements will still be created
but they will not be connected to the SADL or CSV-specified abstract
data elements such as Requirements.

The `ingest_data` can be run multiple times, and should be run at
least once after every set of `make` operations to ingest updated
information.
