This directory contains Prolog modules offering tools for loading OWL models in
and out of a Fuseki instance, as well as several Prolog relations for querying
the ontology.

# Command-line Usage

NOTE: For the following commands to work, you will want to have
generated some data for them to use.  For instance, to get the
"TurnstileSystem" data generated, you can prepend
`assist/databin` to your `PATH` and then run `make` on the
`Makefile` in the `Turnstile-Ontology/02-Software/03-Implementation`
directory.  The `databin` provides instrumented tools like `gcc` that
record build-related data during the build.

There are a number of command-line utilities that can be used with the
Prolog modules in this directory:

* `analyze` Runs an analysis of the ontology model and any associated
  instantiated data.  Command-line options can be used to specify the
  data model to be loaded and which subset of the data model
  instances to display.

  ```shell
  analyze -h
  analyze -i http://turnstilesystem/CounterApplication
  ```

* `check` Runs various tests and checks on the ontology model and any
  associated instantiated data.  Similar command-line options to the
  `analyze` command, viewable via the `-h` flag.

  ```shell
  check -h
  check -v
  ```

  The various checks performed by this tool are designed to be
  extensible.  Adding new checks for ontology invariants is
  encouraged by both RACK developers and users.

  By default, check loads the ontology (model) from the RACK-Ontology
  directory, recognizers from the databin directory, and instance data
  from the Turnstile software implementation directory.  The -m flag
  can be used to select a different ontology, and the -d flag can
  specify a different data location.

  By default, check will ingest all .owl files in the directories
  identified.  It can alternatively read from a live RDF database
  (e.g. Fuseki) if given a URL instead.

* `ingest_data` Loads the ontology model (from disk or RACK/Fuseki),
  a set of data recognizers, and then the data to be recognized,
  instantiating that data against the ontology model.  Writes the
  result to disk or back to the RACK/Fuseki server.  See the `-h`
  flag for usage details.

  ```shell
  ingest_data -h
  ingest_data http://TurnstileSystem/CounterApplication models/TurnstileSystem/src
  ```

  The above would ingest all build/test datafiles generated during
  the build process in the `Turnstile-Ontology/02-Software/03-Implementation` directory.
  The results would be loaded into the RACK database being served at
  `http://localhost:3030` as instance data in the
  `http://TurnstileSystem/CounterApplication` namespace.

  The typical usage is to:

   1. perform a build with the `databin` directory
      in the `PATH` so that the wrappers in that directory can capture the
      build information into datafiles in that directory, then
   2. `ingest_data` to load that data as instances in the RACK database, then
   3. `analyze` or `check` that data.

  The `ingest_data` tool is designed to be extensible.  A RACK user
  can emit `.rack` files (or an equivalent) during their analysis of
  the data.  By creating corresponding data recognizers for the data
  in those `.rack` files, the `ingest_data` tool will be able to
  upload the recognized data into the RACK database for those
  processes as well as the ones defined in the RACK distribution.  For
  more information, see the documentation on "Recognizers for Loaded
  Data" in the [RACK model management Prolog file: rack/model.pl](rack/model.pl).

* `sadl2owl` Performs a conversion of the `.sadl` files in an input
  directory (defaulting to `RACK-Ontology/ontology`) into `.owl`
  files in the specified output directory.  Command-line options are
  visible when invoking with no arguments or with the `-h` flag.

  ```shell
  sadl2owl RACK-OntologyOwlModels
  ```

  Note that this tool is a subset of the Eclipse SADL functionality.
  Primary development should still utilize Eclipse SADL.  This tool
  is intended for batch automation like CI processing and has the
  following limitations:

  * provides conversion for only a subset of SADL (the subset
    utilized by the current ontology specification, which should
    be extended as needed)

  * requires well-formed SADL as input (i.e. it does not provide
    helpful diagnostic or error messages).

  * Does not support the SADL active operators (e.g. `Ask`,
    `Rule`, or `Test`).


# Usage Examples

## Local OWL files, no RDF server

  1. Initial setup

    ```shell
    $ cd assist
    $ export PATH=$(pwd)/bin:$(pwd)/databin:$PATH
    ```

  2. Generate data for the build process of the Turnstile

    ```shell
    $ cd ../Turnstile-Ontology/02-Software/03-Implementation
    $ make clean
    $ make test
    # ... note that the test results include a failure; this is expected.
    $ make dist
    ```

  3. Create an OWL file for the build process data.  This will use a
     turnstile-specific recognizer that makes the additional
     associations between elements based on the PLAN for the
     Turnstile that are not part of the base RACK ontology.

     ```shell
     $ ingest_data -r ../turnstile-ingest.rack -o BUILD_DESC.OWL \
         http://Turnstile/CounterApplication \
         ../../../Turnstile-Ontology
     $ ls BUILD_DESC.OWL
     ```

  4. Run a verification that the BUILD_DESC.OWL data doesn't violate
     any of the constraints or other restrictions associated with the
     RACK ontology:

     ```shell
     $ check -v -d ../../../Turnstile-Ontology
     ```

     Additionally, a summary of the information generated can be seen
     using the analyze tool:

     ```shell
     $ analyze -i http://testdata.org
     ```

## Interacting with an RDF server

  Assuming an RDF server (e.g. Fuseki) is running at localhost port
  3030, the scenario is the same as the local OWL file scenario for
  the first 2 steps, but beginning with step 3:

  3. Upload the data to the RDF service.

     ```shell
     $ ingest_data -r ../turnstile-ingest.rack \
         http://Turnstile/CounterApplication \
         ../../../Turnstile-Ontology
     $ ls BUILD_DESC.OWL
     ```

     This is the same command, but without the specification to output
     to an OWL file; when no output OWL file is specified the
     automatic operation is to upload to the RDF server at localhost
     port 3030.

     Note that if the server is running but not setup yet, this will
     typically result in an error:

     ```
     url `'http://localhost:3030/RACK/upload'' does not exist (status(404,Not Found))
     ```

     To resolve this error, the server must be setup to define the
     RACK dataset.  For Fuseki, this is easily done by opening a
     browser window to http://localhost:3030 and clicking on the
     "manage datasets" tab and "add a new dataset", then specifying
     the "Dataset name" to be "RACK".

     Once the RACK dataset is defined, the above `ingest_data`
     operation should run successfully.

  4. Run a verification that the data in the RDB database doesn't
     violate any of the constraints or other restrictions associated
     with the RACK ontology.  To read from the server, use the `-m`
     argument to specify the URL instead of a directory.

     ```shell
     $ check -v -m http://localhost:3030/
     ```

     Or similarly the analyze command can access the live RDB database:

     ```shell
     $ analyze -m http://localhost:3030/ -i http://testdata.org
     ```

     Note that when reading OWL files from the local filesystem, the
     ontology model exists in a different location than the instance
     data (e.g. Turnstile), so the `check` and `analyze` commands
     allow the `-m` and `-d` flags to specify both locations,
     respectively.  When reading from an RDF database (e.g. Fuseki),
     all of the information is available in a single place, so only
     the `-m` specification is needed.


# Prolog API Usage

You can read the code's documentation, as well as a rendering of this very file,
by running `swipl` **from this directory**, and entering:

```prolog
[documentation/serve].
```

This command should set up a local pldoc webserver instance listening at
[http://localhost:4040/pldoc](http://localhost:4040/pldoc).

## Setup

In order to load `rack_model.pl`, you will need a Prolog interpreter.  One such
interpreter is the SWI Prolog implementation.  You can use it to load the module
in a read-eval print loop (REPL) by running, from the `RACK/` folder:

```shell
swipl -s ./assist/bin/rack/model.pl
```

## Manipulating models

### Loading

You may load a model in memory using one of the three following forms:

```prolog
load_local_model('./Turnstile-Ontology/OwlModels').
```

The local form takes as argument a path to a directory containing OWL files
to load.

NOTE: The path in this example may not correspond to the path on your
machine, please adapt the command accordingly.

---

```prolog
load_model_from_url('http://192.168.0.32:3030/').
```

This form expects to find a Fuseki instance.
NOTE: currently you should make sure to include the final '/'.

---

```prolog
load_model_from_rack().
```

This form expects to find a Fuseki instance living at `localhost:3030/RACK`,
which can easily be obtained for testing by running:

```shell
fuseki-server --mem RACK/
```

### Saving locally

There are two forms for saving the model in memory to a local file:

```prolog
save_model_to_file('path/to/filename.owl').
```

---

```prolog
save_model_to_file('path/to/filename.owl', 'SomeNamespace').
```

They will both write out to the specified file, the latter allowing the
specification of a namespace for the triples.

### Uploading to Fuseki

There are two forms for uploading the model in memory to a Fuseki
instance.  Both specify the Graph to upload to:

```prolog
upload_model_to_url('http://192.168.0.32:3030/', 'http://graph/name').
```

---

```prolog
upload_model_to_rack('http://graph/name').
```

Like in the loading case, the `upload_model_to_url/2` expects to find a
Fuseki instance at that location, while `upload_model_to_rack/1` expects the
instance to live at `localhost:3030/RACK`.

# Design Notes

## Node identifiers

`PROV-S#ACTIVITY` operations are typically annotated by a date + PID
(process ID) nonce value; repeated runs of the same activity will
have a different nonce.

`SOFTWARE#FILE` instances are typically annotated by a SHA1 hash of the file
itself, for stable references that change only when the file itself
changes (independent of filename).

Build tools that invoke other build tools should have a way to
correlate these invocations.  For the databin `make` wrapper, the
wrapper sets the `MAKE_DATABIN` which other databin wrappers can use
to associate themselves with.  The `MAKE_DATABIN` wrapper is a
colon-separated list to handle recursive `make` invocations.  Other
build tools can use a similar technique.

## Performance

The following data is collected for processing a moderately large code
base (turnstile + ffmpeg) and a very large codebase.
