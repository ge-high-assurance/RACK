# Nodegroups folder

A **nodegroup** is a SemTK construct that represents a sub-graph.
SemTK generates SPARQL queries from nodegroups.  They also may contain
ingestion templates which allow SemTK to map CSV files to the subgraph
and generate INSERT queries.

## Sub-folders

Each sub-folder has nodegroups for particular purposes or applications.

- **queries** - Sample derived RACK queries

These sub-folders will be in RACK-in-a-Box images but not in the git
repository because these sub-folders are automatically generated:

- **CDR** - Common Data Representation CSV files
- **ingestion** - For populating RACK via CSV files

NOTE: Some nodegroups may already be available in the SPARQLgraph
application under the menu `Nodegroup->Load from store...`.

## Using with SPARQLgraph

The ingestion folder contains a set of generic .json nodegroup files.
Each of these ingestion nodegroup is derived from the RACK ontology
and is provided for the user to get started with RACK. To use with
SPARQLgraph, simply drag and drop one of these .json files onto the
Query tab. In the CDR folder is a set of generic Common Data
Representation .csv files. Each CDR has a corresponding .json file
from the ingestion folder. The .csv file contains only the headers and
is provided for the user to fill in with their own data. To use with
SPQRQLgraph, drag and drop a .csv with your rows of data to where it
says "Drop CSV file" on the Import tab. Hit Import and your data will
be added to what's populated in RACK.

## Manually populating SemTK with a query set

Loading queries sets is documented on [semtk/Standalone
Executables](https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/wiki/Standalone-Executables):

```shell
java -cp /path/to/standaloneExecutables-jar-with-dependencies.jar com.ge.research.semtk.standaloneExecutables.StoreNodeGroup http://server:12056 store_data.csv
```

NOTE: Check out the RACK [command-line interface](../cli/) which may
be easier to use.
