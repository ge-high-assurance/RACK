The returned results (i.e., the column headers) are named following the below convention:
- If itâ€™s the top node, it is named <b> CLASS_identifier </b>
- Otherwise, it is named <b> property_CLASS_identifier </b>

When nodegroups contain multiple instances of the same CLASS, then use the class name to distinguish the returned values. For example:
- property_CLASS_identifier
- property_CLASS_0_identifier
