CWE-1320,Improper Protection for Out of Bounds Signal Level Alerts,Untrusted agents can disable alerts about signal conditions exceeding limits or the response mechanism that handles such alerts.
CWE-1321,Improperly Controlled Modification of Object Prototype Attributes ('Prototype Pollution'),"The software receives input from an upstream component that specifies attributes that are to be initialized or updated in an object, but it does not properly control modifications of attributes of the object prototype."
CWE-1322,"Use of Blocking Code in Single-threaded, Non-blocking Context","The product uses a non-blocking model that relies on a single threaded process for features such as scalability, but it contains code that can block when it is invoked."
CWE-1323,Improper Management of Sensitive Trace Data,Trace data collected from several sources on the System-on-Chip (SoC) is stored in unprotected locations or transported to untrusted agents.
CWE-1324,Sensitive Information Accessible by Physical Probing of JTAG Interface,"Sensitive information in clear text on the JTAG interface may be examined by an eavesdropper, e.g. by placing a probe device on the interface such as a logic analyzer, or a corresponding software technique."
CWE-1325,Improperly Controlled Sequential Memory Allocation,"The product manages a group of objects or resources and performs a separate memory allocation for each object, but it does not properly limit the total amount of memory that is consumed by all of the combined objects."
CWE-1326,Missing Immutable Root of Trust in Hardware,A missing immutable root of trust in the hardware results in the ability to bypass secure boot or execute untrusted or adversarial boot code.
CWE-1327,Binding to an Unrestricted IP Address,"The product assigns the address 0.0.0.0 for a database server, a cloud service/instance, or any computing resource that communicates remotely."
CWE-1328,Security Version Number Mutable to Older Versions,"Security-version number in hardware is mutable, resulting in the ability to downgrade (roll-back) the boot firmware to vulnerable code versions."
CWE-1329,Reliance on Component That is Not Updateable,The product contains a component that cannot be updated or patched in order to remove vulnerabilities or significant bugs.
CWE-1330,Remanent Data Readable after Memory Erase,Confidential information stored in memory circuits is readable or recoverable after being cleared or erased.
CWE-1331,Improper Isolation of Shared Resources in Network On Chip (NoC),"The Network On Chip (NoC) does not isolate or incorrectly isolates its on-chip-fabric and internal resources such that they are shared between trusted and untrusted agents, creating timing channels."
CWE-1332,Improper Handling of Faults that Lead to Instruction Skips,The device is missing or incorrectly implements circuitry or sensors that detect and mitigate the skipping of security-critical CPU instructions when they occur.
CWE-1333,Inefficient Regular Expression Complexity,"The product uses a regular expression with an inefficient, possibly exponential worst-case computational complexity that consumes excessive CPU cycles."
CWE-1334,Unauthorized Error Injection Can Degrade Hardware Redundancy,An unauthorized agent can inject errors into a redundant block to deprive the system of redundancy or put the system in a degraded operating mode.
CWE-1335,Incorrect Bitwise Shift of Integer,An integer value is specified to be shifted by a negative amount or an amount greater than or equal to the number of bits contained in the value causing an unexpected or indeterminate result.
CWE-1336,Improper Neutralization of Special Elements Used in a Template Engine,"The product uses a template engine to insert or process externally-influenced input, but it does not neutralize or incorrectly neutralizes special elements or syntax that can be interpreted as template expressions or other code directives when processed by the engine."
