# RACK-box

This README is for RACK developers and RACK-in-a-Box power users who
want to build their own rack-box images instead of downloading
already-built images from our [Docker
Hub](https://hub.docker.com/repository/docker/gehighassurance/rack-box)
or [GitHub
Releases](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/releases) pages.
Note that these already-built images were built automatically by our
RACK repository's continuous integration and release workflows.
Please see these [workflows](../.github/workflows) for the most up to
date way to build rack-box images since this README may be out of
date.

## Environment variables needed before building

If you are building on a local area network behind a corporate proxy,
you will need to set some proxy environment variables before building
your rack-box images.  That should be all you need to do; Packer will
inject `http_proxy`, `https_proxy`, and `no_proxy` environment
variables into each box's build if these variables are defined in your
environment.  However, if you run Packer in an Ubuntu shell on Windows
Subsystem for Linux (WSL1), Packer may fail to inject these
environment variables automatically.  If so, you will have to pass the
variables explicitly in your packer build command like this:

`packer build -var "http_proxy=${http_proxy}" -var "https_proxy=${https_proxy}" -var "no_proxy=${no_proxy}" rack-box-docker.json`

## Files needed before building

You will need to download 9 files into the `files` subdirectory before
building your rack-box images.  Please see the
[commands](../.github/workflows/actions/download/action.yml) used by
our workflows for the most up to date way to download these files,
although we will mention each file here as well:

- `files/fuseki.tar.gz`: Download latest Fuseki release tarball from
  <https://jena.apache.org/download/> and rename it (note we still are
  using version 3.16.0, not the latest release, though)

- `files/semtk.tar.gz`: Download latest SemTK release tarball from
  <https://github.com/ge-semtk/semtk/releases> and rename it

- `files/style.css`: Download latest CSS stylesheet (`style.css`) for
  rendering markdown from
  [markdown-to-html-github-style](https://github.com/KrauseFx/markdown-to-html-github-style)

- `files/systemctl3.py`: Download latest systemctl script
  (`files/docker/systemctl3.py`) from
  [docker-systemd-replacement](https://github.com/gdraheim/docker-systemctl-replacement)

- `files/rack.tar.gz`: Package the RACK ontology and data (`tar cfz
  RACK/rack-box/files/rack.tar.gz --exclude=.git --exclude=.github
  --exclude=assist --exclude=cli --exclude=rack-box --exclude=tests
  --exclude=tools RACK`)

- `files/rack-assist.tar.gz`: Package the RACK ASSIST (`tar cfz
  RACK/rack-box/files/rack-assist.tar.gz RACK/assist`)

- `files/rack-cli.tar.gz`: Package the RACK CLI (`tar cfz
  RACK/rack-box/files/rack-cli.tar.gz
  RACK/cli/{setup-rack.sh,wheels}`), see [Build the RACK
  CLI](#Build-the-RACK-CLI) for build instructions first

- `files/{documentation.html,index.html}`: Package the RACK
  documentation, see [Package RACK
  documentation](#Package-RACK-documentation) for commands

Once you have downloaded these files, skip to [Build the rack-box
images](#Build-the-rack-box-images) for the next step.

## Build the RACK CLI

You will need to install these packages before building the RACK CLI:

    sudo apt install python3-pip
    python3 -m pip install --upgrade pip setuptools wheel

In the cli directory of your checkout of the RACK repository, run
these commands to build the RACK CLI:

    pip3 wheel --wheel-dir=wheels -r requirements.txt
    pip3 wheel --wheel-dir=wheels .

## Package RACK documentation

You will need to install two programs, the [Github Wikito
Converter](https://github.com/yakivmospan/github-wikito-converter) and
the [markdown-to-html](https://github.com/cwjohan/markdown-to-html):

    sudo npm install -g github-wikito-converter markdown-to-html

In the directory above your checkouts of the RACK and RACK.wiki
repositories, run these commands:

    cp RACK.wiki/_Footer.md RACK.wiki/Copyright.md
    gwtc -t RACK-in-a-Box RACK.wiki
    rm RACK.wiki/Copyright.md
    markdown -t RACK-in-a-box -s style.css RACK.wiki/_Welcome.md > index.html
    sed -i -e 's/>NodeGroupService/ onclick="javascript:event.target.port=12058">NodeGroupService/' index.html
    mv documentation.html index.html RACK/rack-box/files

## Build the rack-box images

You will need to install [Packer](https://www.packer.io/) if you don't
have it.  Packer will read instructions from the rack-box JSON files
and use files in the `files`, `http`, and `scripts` directories to
build the rack-box images.  The following Packer commands will build
Docker, Hyper-V, and VirtualBox rack-box images:

    packer build rack-box-docker.json
    packer build rack-box-hyperv.json
    packer build rack-box-virtualbox.json

When Packer finishes these build commands, it will save the Docker
rack-box image in your local Docker image cache and save the Hyper-V &
VirtualBox rack-box images to new subdirectories called
`output-hyperv-iso` and `output-virtualbox-iso`.  Your Hyper-V and
VirtualBox GUI program can import these subdirectories directly into
newly created virtual machines.

## Release process

When it is time to make a new release, perform the following steps:

1. Update version numbers in some files (see the next section).
2. Tag the RACK wiki with the version tag name since our GitHub
   Actions workflow will check out the wiki using the same tag.
3. Click the `Draft a new release` button in the GitHub Releases page,
   enter the release name, version tag name, and description, and
   click the `Publish release` button.
4. Our GitHub Actions release workflow will build and push or upload
   the rack-box images to Docker Hub and GitHub automatically.

## Update documentation pages

Before making a new release, update version numbers or instructions in
the following places:

### RACK Box

- [ ] [Docker-Hub-README.md](Docker-Hub-README.md)
- [ ] [GitHub-Release-README.md](GitHub-Release-README.md)
- [ ] [README.md](README.md)

### RACK Wiki

- [ ] [Install-a-Docker-RACK-Box](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/Install-a-Docker-RACK-Box)
- [ ] [Install-a-Virtual-RACK-Box](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/Install-a-Virtual-RACK-Box)
- [ ] [Welcome](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/_Welcome)

Note that creating a GitHub release tags the RACK repo automatically,
but we need to manually tag the RACK wiki with the same tag in advance
since its pages must go into the rack-box image too.

## Using `act` to Run CI Locally

The [act](https://github.com/nektos/act) tool can be used to run (an
approximation of) the Github Actions workflow locally:

- Download a binary release of Packer for Ubuntu, and place the
  `packer` executable in the `rack-box/` directory
- Install `act`
- Generate a Github [personal access
  token](https://docs.github.com/en/free-pro-team@latest/github/authenticating-to-github/creating-a-personal-access-token)
- Create a `.secrets` file containing
  `GITHUB_TOKEN=<your-github-PAT-here>`
- Run `act --secret-file .secrets -P
  ubuntu-latest=nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04`

The Docker image `nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04` is quite large
(approximately 18GB), so (1) you'll need enough free disk space to
store it and (2) the first execution of `act` takes a while because it
downloads this image.

Unfortunately, `act` [does not yet support Ubuntu
20.04](https://github.com/nektos/act-environments/issues/4).

### Troubleshooting

#### "volume is in use"

If you see a message like this:

    Error: Error response from daemon: remove act-Build-Lint-shell-scripts-and-the-RACK-CLI: volume is in use

You can forcibly stop and remove the `act` Docker containers and their volumes:

    docker stop $(docker ps -a | grep "nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04" | awk '{print $1}')
    docker rm $(docker ps -a | grep "nektos/act-environments-ubuntu:18.04" | awk '{print $1}')
    docker volume rm $(docker volume ls --filter dangling=true | grep -o -E "act-.+$")

There may also be a more precise solution to this issue, but the above works.

#### "permission denied while trying to connect to the Docker daemon socket"

`act` needs to be run with enough privileges to run Docker containers. Try
`sudo -g docker act ...` (or an equivalent invocation for your OS/distro).
