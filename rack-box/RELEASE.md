# Process to make a new RACK release

When it is time to make a new release of RACK, perform the following
steps:

1. Update version numbers or instructions in the following files
   within the RACK and RACK.wiki repositories:

   RACK/rack-box/

   - [ ] [Docker-Hub-README.md](Docker-Hub-README.md)
   - [ ] [GitHub-Release-README.md](GitHub-Release-README.md)
   - [ ] [RELEASE.md](RELEASE.md)
   
   RACK/cli/
   - [ ] [setup-owl.sh](../cli/setup-owl.sh)

   RACK.wiki/

   - [ ] [01-Release-Schedule](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/01-Release-Schedule)
   - [ ] [02-Run-a-RACK-Box-container](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/02-Run-a-RACK-Box-container)
   - [ ] [03-Run-a-RACK-Box-VM](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/03-Run-a-RACK-Box-VM)
   - [ ] [Home](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/Home)
   - [ ] [Welcome](https://github.com/ge-high-assurance/RACK/wiki/_Welcome)

   After you save these files, commit and push those changes to both
   the RACK and RACK.wiki repositories:

   ```shell
   cd RACK.wiki
   git commit -a -m "Update versions for next release"
   git push
   cd ../RACK
   git commit -a -m "Update versions for next release"
   git push
   ```

2. Manually tag the RACK.wiki repository with the new version number
   as a tag name since our GitHub Actions release workflow will check
   out both the RACK and RACK.wiki repositories with the same tag
   name.  Note that publishing a GitHub release in step 3 tags the
   RACK repository automatically, but we need to manually tag the
   RACK.wiki repository with the same tag in advance:

   ```shell
   cd RACK.wiki
   git tag v12.0
   git push --tag
   ```

3. Click the `Draft a new release` button in the GitHub Releases page,
   enter the release name, version tag name, and description, and
   click the `Publish release` button.

4. Monitor our GitHub Actions release workflow to make sure it builds,
   pushes, and uploads the rack-box images to Docker Hub and GitHub
   successfully.
