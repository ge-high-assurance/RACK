// This example is to simply illustrate a security scenario for Turnstile.
// This is not the only way to incorporate security, and ARCOS performers
//		may choose to incorporate security differently.
// To simplify everything we have  
// 		repeated portions of the Turnstile including requirements in SADL
//		added some properties from CPS.sadl to Turnstile components
//		the security scenario consists of communication from InGate to CounterApplication 
//			being vulnerable to Content Spoofing 
//		added relevant CAPECs to capture this threat (CAPEC-148)
//		added NIST controls that mitigate Content Spoofing threat on the connection
//			and these are IA-3 (Device Identification And Authentication) 
//			and IA-3-1 (Cryptographic Bidirectional Authentication)
//			so, added a CONTROLSET with these 2 controls
//		added a rule that shows how the Turnstile component properties lead identifying
//			Content Spoofing threat
//			While we do this via a rule, it would be identified by ARCOS performers using
//			their tools and that determination would be data that is then ingested in RACK.
//		added additional requirements that when satisfied mitigate this Content Spoofing threat
//		This file is in sadl-examples folder in GIT.
