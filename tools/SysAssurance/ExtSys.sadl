// do we need to define SoftwareRequirement, System level requirements?
Requirements is a type of Thing,
    described by settingComponent with values of type SA:Component, // the controlled variable may be set in multiple subsystems
    described by controlledVariable with values of type QualifiedVariable,
    described by monitoredVariable with values of type QualifiedVariable.

{HLR (alias "high-level requirement"),
 LLR (alias "low-level requirement"),
 DHLR (alias "derived high-level requirement"),
 DLLR (alias "derived low-level requirement")
} are types of Requirements.

QualifiedVariable is a class,
    described by varChain with a single value of type string, // full path name
    described by varType with a single value of type string,
    described by varRange with a single value of type InterfaceDefinition.

InterfaceDefinition is a class
//    described by reference_class with a single value of type ???
//    described by reference_property with a single value of type ???
    described by functional_min with a single value of type float
    described by functional_max with a single value of type float
    described by physical_min with a single value of type float
    described by physical_max with a single value of type float
    described by tolerance with a single value of type float
    described by resolution with a single value of type float.

Hazards is a type of Thing
    described by mitigatingReq with values of type Requirements
    described by dal with values of type DAL.

DAL is a class, must be one of {DAL-A, DAL-B, DAL-C, DAL-D}.

// extend System and Component with requirements and hazards
req describes SA:System with values of type Requirements.
hazard describes SA:System with values of type Hazards.

presentInReq describes SA:Component with values of type Requirements.
associatedWithHazard describes SA:Component with values of type Hazards.
